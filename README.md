# Credit Card Validator (C++)

This is a self-learning project created during my 1st semester.
The goal was to practice C++ fundamentals like:
- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals
- String handling
- Logical thinking

## What this program does
- Validates a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm
- Identifies card type:
  - Visa
  - MasterCard
  - American Express
- Checks card-specific rules:
  - Length
  - Prefix
  - CVV format

## Why I built this
I wanted to:
- Apply loops and conditions to a real-world problem
- Learn how input validation works
- Improve my debugging and logical reasoning skills

## What I learned
- implementations of functions in real life
- the usage of loops to support the inputs and outputs
- slowly taking time to understand the desired logic and implementing in into the code.

## Limitations
- This is a console-based program
- It does not perform real payments
- CVV is checked only for format, not authenticity
